## Details
This question answering system performs two tasks: document retrieval and passage retrieval. Our system will have access to a corpus of text documents. When presented with a query (a question in English asked by the user), document retrieval will first identify which document(s) are most relevant to the query. Once the top documents are found, the top document(s) will be subdivided into passages (in this case, sentences) so that the most relevant passage to the question can be determined. <br>
Most relevant documents and passages are determined through using a combination of **inverse document frequency and a query term density measure**.

## Required dependencies
